# PhotoStore
A **buggy** web application to store and share your photos

## Before you start
This project is divided into two branches
- `main` - Cyber Security
  - finding bugs
  - patching them

- `dev` - Web Development
  - improvements or additions in frontend and/or backend

### For Cyber Security
Once you have figured out a bug, create a **POC** - Proof Of Concept<br>
You will be required to provide your **POC** within your **Pull Request**<br>
Or else it won't be considered for evaluation and you won't be rewarded with any points whatsoever

Given that you would have to go through the code and understand how is it all working<br>
This project may be a little harder for the beginners<br>
No worries! During the whole event, some **hints** will be dropped within the respective **Issue**

### For Web Development
Other than the issues provided in [Issues](https://github.com/opencodeiiita/PhotoStore/issues)<br>
You are **not restricted** from adding your own features<br>
However, it is upto the organizers and/or mentors whether to reward points for it or not<br>

For any new feature that you come up with<br>
please attach screenshots with _proper details_ in your Pull request

It will make it easier for the mentors to get to know about feature

## Requirements
